In this challenge, I have applied what I have learned about Matplotlib and put myself in the shoes of a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. Throughout this challenge, I used the data set (which includes 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens), to generate tables and figures to create a technical report of the clinical study.
